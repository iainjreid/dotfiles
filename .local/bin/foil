# A super simple utility to run a program without network access.
#
# Usage:
#	foil ping www.example.com
#	-> ping: www.example.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
#
# Notes:
#
# * "-r" is preferred over "-c" to maintain BusyBox compatibility. The program
#   will think that it's running as root, but that's its problem.
#

exec unshare -r -n -- "$@"
